# Weighted-Graph-Nodes
Create new weighted graph using Prim's algorithm

Hello! Using the built-in priority queue and vector classes, we create nodes with weighted edges between one another. There are no floating nodes present.
After the construction of the graph, we implement Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (greedy algorithm) of the created graph. It has a time complexity of 
O((V + E) * log V), with V representing vertices and E representing edges.
